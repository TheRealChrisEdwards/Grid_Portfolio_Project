          <p>Hello, my name is Chris Edwards, and this is my web development portfolio! I've designed this page to give you a general overview of who I am, a little bit about me personally, and most importantly, the projects I've completed or are currently working on. The Contact Page at the bottom contains links to all of my relevant social media &amp; coding website profiles. That said, I would refer you to my LinkedIn profile if you are interested in my work experience and professional networks. I really wanted to make this page revolve around the projects that I invest my time &amp; efforts. In case you're wondering who 'The Real' Chris Edwards is (that's not a pretentious rhetorical question, either), I started using this handle, because it became incredibly frustrating when I discovered the amount of people with the name Chris Edwards, and the abundance of affiliated usernames. To make my online identity somewhat identifiable among others I code &amp; collaborate with, I decided to use the name 'TheRealChrisEdwards' to solve this dilemma. So, if you see TRCE online somewhere, that's what I've invented to reference myself. I know, genius right. Be sure to look through some of my projects, and feel free to pepper any negative feedback with something constructive for me to use. If you'd like to discuss anything further, please connect with me via social media. I'm always working on something at least that's what I tell myself), but I'll do my best to keep this site updated with my most recent work. I also have a blog that I host on WordPress, and I've included links to that as well. I decided to keep the two seperate, but you can read about that here. Thanks for checking me out, and there's always more to be revealed...
